# Introduction

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, adding static types and advanced features.

## Why Use TypeScript?

- **Static Typing**: Catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime.
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: Improved autocompletion, type checking, and code navigation.
- **Advanced Type System**: Interfaces, enums, generics, and more for expressive code.
- **Modern JavaScript Features**: Use the latest JS features with compatibility.
- **Incremental Adoption**: Gradually integrate TypeScript into existing projects.

# What's Wrong with JavaScript?

JavaScript is a powerful and widely-used language, but it has some limitations that TypeScript addresses:

## Lack of Static Typing

- **JavaScript**: Dynamically typed, leading to type-related errors discovered only at runtime.
- **TypeScript**: Introduces static typing, catching errors at compile-time.

## Complexity in Large Codebases

- **JavaScript**: Managing and maintaining large codebases can be difficult without static types.
- **TypeScript**: Provides a type system that makes code more predictable and maintainable.

## Limited Tooling Support

- **JavaScript**: Basic IDE support with limited autocompletion, type checking, and refactoring.
- **TypeScript**: Enhanced IDE support with robust autocompletion, type checking, and intelligent refactoring.

## Less Expressive Type System

- **JavaScript**: Lacks advanced type system features like interfaces, enums, and generics.
- **TypeScript**: Offers a powerful type system with interfaces, enums, generics, and more.

## Inconsistent Browser Support

- **JavaScript**: Rapid evolution leads to inconsistent support across different browsers.
- **TypeScript**: Allows the use of modern JavaScript features with transpilation for compatibility with older environments.

## Advantages Over JavaScript

- **Early Error Detection**: Reduce runtime errors with static typing.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Enforce better coding practices and clear documentation.
- **Refactoring Support**: Safer and more manageable refactoring in large codebases.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Types act as documentation, aiding team collaboration.
- **Manage Complexity**: Better suited for large and complex projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with TypeScript, you'll need to install it:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
